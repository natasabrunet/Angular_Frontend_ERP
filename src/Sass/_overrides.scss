ALERT!

	YOU SHOULD LEAVE THIS FILE EMPTY

	Overriding B5 classes by old technique (used in Bootstrap)
	of using the "!important" CSS rule is not a good practice.
	Use it under your responsibility, only in extreme cases.
	That technique is really NOT encouraged.

	There's a better way of customizing B5 classes. 
	To do so, go to this project's...
	
	"Sass/_custom-classes.scss"
